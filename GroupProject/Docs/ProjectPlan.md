## 2 Process Description

- Create UML design
  - Develop the UML diagram to represent the class structure, interactions, and functionalities of the app. Ensure the UML design captures all requirements.
  - Assignment requirements.
  - A UML diagram that includes all classes to be implemented and fully captures the app's requirements.

- Create architectural design
  - Define the app's architecture, including component and deployment designs. Create a component diagram to represent functionalities and interactions between users and UI, and a deployment diagram to outline how the app will be released.
  - UML design and assignment requirements.
  - Exit criteria:
    - A component diagram that adequately captures the app's functionalities and interactions.
    - A deployment diagram that clearly outlines how we wanted to release the app
      
-  Design user interface (UI)
    - Create wireframe/mockup for the app's user interface, ensuring the layout and format align with the requirements
    - Assignment requirements.
    - Wireframe/mockup that capture all functionalities and provide a clear representation of the UI.
 
- Develop test plan
  - Create a detailed test plan, including test strategy and test cases.
  - UML design, architectural design, and UI design
  - A test plan document with a detailed test strategy and comprehensive test cases.

- Software development
  - Program the classes and methods for both the backend and frontend functionalities based on the existing design files.
  - UML design, architectural design (component and deployment), and UI design.
  - A functional app ready for testing.

- Execute the test plan
  - Implement the test plan by running test cases to identify and fix bugs, ensuring the app meets all requirements and functions as intended.
  - Test plan, testing criteria, and functional app.
  - A bug-free app that passes all test cases.

- Deploy App
  - Package the app into an APK file and demonstrate that the test plan is conclusive with the final results. Prepare the app for release.
  - Initial tested app.
  - A deployed app with an APK file ready for distribution.
